[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40vendii-tech%2Fcircleci-coverage-github-reporter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40vendii-tech%2Fcircleci-coverage-github-reporter)

Report Jest/Istanbul coverage statistics from CircleCI to GitHub.

Project based on [coverage-github-reporter](https://github.com/vivlabs/coverage-github-reporter).

## Setup

### GitHub Auth Token

A GitHub auth token is required to post a comment on github. I recommend creating a separate "bot" GitHub account with
access to your repos.

1. Navigate to [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) on GitHub
2. Click "Generate new token" and generate a new token (with **repo** access if your repo is private)
3. Open the CircleCI project settings
4. Navigate to Build Settings > Environment variables
5. Add a new variable called `GH_AUTH_TOKEN` with the new token

For subsequent projects:

1. Open the CircleCI project settings
2. Navigate to Build Settings > Environment variables
3. Click "Import Variable(s)"
4. Select a project that you've previous added `GH_AUTH_TOKEN` to
5. Click the checkbox next to `GH_AUTH_TOKEN` and import

### CircleCI Artifact API Token

To access artifacts for private repos, a CircleCI API token is required.

1. Open the CircleCI project settings
2. Navigate to Permissions > API Permissions
3. Click "Create Token"

- Select "Build Artifacts" from scope dropdown
- Name the token "artifacts" (or whatever you prefer)

4. Navigate to Build Settings > Environment variables
5. Add a new variable called `CIRCLE_CI_API_TOKEN` with the new token

### Run Jest with Coverage reporting

Add to your `package.json`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @vendii/circleci-coverage-github-reporter
```

If you're using Jest, I suggest adding a test script along these lines:

```json
    "scripts": {
        "test-ci": "jest --ci --silent --coverage"
    }
```

This will generate a coverage in `coverage/`

### CircleCI configuration

Update your `.circleci/config.yml`:

```yml
general:
  artifacts:
    - "coverage/lcov-report"

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      # â€¦ other steps (npm/yarn install, lint, etc)

      - run:
          name: Test
          command: npm run test-ci

      # Store coverage artifacts so they can be browsed and be diffed by other builds
      - store_artifacts:
          path: coverage
          destination: coverage

      - run:
          name: Post coverage comment to GitHub
          command: npx circleci-coverage-github-reporter
```

### Customization

The `circleci-coverage-github-reporter` CLI has some options to customize behavior:

```
  Options:

    -v, --verbose [true, false]  Defaults to true
    -b, --branch [value]         Base branch to use if not PR (defaults to "master")

    -r, --coverage-root [value]  Relative path to coverage html root (for artifact links) (defaults to "coverage/lcov-report")
    -h, --help                   Output usage information
